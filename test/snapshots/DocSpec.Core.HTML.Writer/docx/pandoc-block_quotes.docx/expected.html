    <h2>
      Some block quotes, in different ways
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is the proper way, with a style
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I don’t know why this would be in italics, but so it appears to be on my screen.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And this is also a proper way, with a different style
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This is called the Intense Quote style.
      </p>
